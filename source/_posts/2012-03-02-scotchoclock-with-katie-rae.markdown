[Katie Rae]("http://twitter.com/ktrae") is a force to be reckoned with in the Boston scene.  She is currently the managing director of [TechStars Boston]("http://www.techstars.com/program/locations/boston/") and is also a seed stage investor and mentor through [Project 11]("http://project11.com/") (with [#RubyRiot]("http://therubyriot.com/") Godfather, [Reed Sturtevant]("https://twitter.com/#!/reedsturtevant")).

Katie is one of the most experienced product people in town, having headed up product at Microsoft Startup Labs, Eons, Lycos and many other great companies.  While she is one of the busiest people I’ve ever met, she is also one of the most helpful and giving of her time.  But what makes Katie so special is her NY Metro North commuter rail conductor’s accent.  It’s pretty incredible!

If you ever need help fleshing out your product, getting advice on raising capital or figuring out how to get into the TechStars program, get in touch with Katie!

I was fortunate enough to meet [Karl]("http://twitter.com/karlbuttner") a few years ago, right after he had sold his company [170 Systems]("http://www.crunchbase.com/company/170-systems").  He was looking for the next thing to do and told me that he wanted to get more involved with mentoring startups, especially those founded by college students and twenty somethings.  I wasn’t sure if Karl was just paying me lip service but sure enough, a few months later, Karl was named the [Chief Mentorship Officer]("http://masschallenge.org/masschallenge_team") at [MassChallenge]("http://masschallenge.org/").

Since meeting Karl, he has played a huge role in making sure hundreds of companies in and around Boston have the right folks mentoring them.  If you’re looking to learn more about MassChallenge or just want to chat with someone about your startup, make sure you get in touch with Karl!

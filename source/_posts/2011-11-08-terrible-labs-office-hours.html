title: Terrible Labs Office Hours
---

<p>Over the past few months we&#8217;ve chatted with a bunch of people looking for advice on the technical side of their projects.  We&#8217;ve had conversations ranging from hiring technical co-founders to the tradeoffs involved when deciding to use relational databases vs. document databases.</p>

<p>So we thought we&#8217;d open our doors (or Gemvara&#8217;s) to help anyone with their technical roadblocks.  We&#8217;re kicking off our first round of office hours on Wednesday November 16 starting at 1:30pm.  </p>

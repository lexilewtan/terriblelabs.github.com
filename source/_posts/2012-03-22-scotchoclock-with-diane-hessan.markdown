Every time you talk to [Diane](http://twitter.com/communispaceceo) about her company [Communispace](http://communispace.com/), she speaks with an energy and enthusiasm that’s contagious.  I remember a lunch where Diane shared the eventful story of Communispace and I’ll say that if Diane ever wants to pursue a new career, she is one of the best storytellers I have met!

Even though Diane is CEO of a huge company, on the board of many organizations and an avid Twitter user, she makes time to help entrepreneurs.  So, if you’re looking for advice and guidance on your company or want to get experience working for a great CEO at a great company, get in touch with Diane!

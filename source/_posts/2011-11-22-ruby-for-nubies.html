<p>We&#8217;ve gotten a great response from <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/doctorzaius/status/136790167821357056" target="_blank">Jeremy&#8217;s tweet</a> about an introductory worshop to Ruby, so we&#8217;ll be hosting one on December 3 from 9am to 3pm.  We have limited spots for this so if you&#8217;d like to come please shoot us a note at <a href="mailto:learn@terriblelabs.com" target="_blank">learn@terriblelabs.com</a>.</p>

<p>This first workshop will be an intro to Ruby (and it looks like this will be an intro to programming for some of the attendees). We won&#8217;t cover anything Rails specific, but we&#8217;ll tailor the content to people who eventually want to level up to Rails.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ll go over basic programming constructs (conditions and loops), functions, blocks, data types, data structures like Array and Hash, and maybe a brief intro to object-oriented programming with Ruby.<br/><br/><span>The format will be something like 15 minutes of lecture/examples with 15-30 minutes to experiment (in pairs) on the new topic, repeat. The goal will be to build out a simple interactive command-line game over the course of the day. We&#8217;ll have a handful of experienced Rubyists to help out with the hands-on work.</span><br/><br/><span>We don&#8217;t have have anything planned beyond this first Nubies workshop. It&#8217;s partly a market test for us (and we&#8217;ve gotten a great response), an opportunity to develop some content, and see what topics and formats might work going forward. I think the next logical step would be more advanced workshops on OOP with Ruby, Rails, JavaScript/CoffeeScript/</span><span>jQuery, etc.</span></p>

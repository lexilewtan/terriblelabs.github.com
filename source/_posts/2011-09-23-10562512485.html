<p>We had another fun night at <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/gemvara">Gemvara</a> working with the <a target="_blank" href="http://developer.runkeeper.com">RunKeeper HealthGraph API</a>.</p>

<p>As we talked about in the last blog post, we&#8217;re still trying to figure out how best to run these hack-fests.  For the next couple months we&#8217;re going to meet up every other Wednesday night at Gemvara from 6pm to 9pm to continue working with the RunKeeper API.  </p>

<p>On November 16th we&#8217;re going to get together for a final presentation night where we can recap on the apps we&#8217;ve built and demo them to the greater Boston community and to the RunKeeper team.</p>

<p>I know<a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/jjacobs22"> Jason Jacobs</a> (CEO of RunKeeper) is willing to leverage the RunKeeper press machine to highlight apps built during APIs and IPAs, so if you&#8217;re interested in getting some exposure for yourself and your app, come out and get involved!</p>

<p>Sign up for the next one on 10/5&#8230;</p>

<p>This past Wednesday, we were psyched to have team <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/evertrue">EverTrue</a> out which included <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/brentgrinna">Brent</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/evertrueeric">Eric</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/jessebardo">Jesse</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/andrewburch">Drew</a>, Courtney, <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/andrhamm">Andrew</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/tonyd256">Anthony</a>.  These guys spent their time building an app that incorporates charitable giving with exercise.  Keep your eye out for their RunKeeper app, I&#8217;ve got a feeling that when they present in November the demo will be very cool!</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/patientslikeme">Patients Like Me</a> was also well represented by <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/semanticart">Jeffrey Chupp</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.patientslikeme.com/members/view/17">Jeff Cole</a>.  Jeffrey continued to work on his app for recording one&#8217;s sleep while Jeff was working on a map overlay that allows Runkeeper users to compare segments of the same route over time.  He&#8217;s currently looking at his morning commute by car, but this easily transfers over to cycling, running and other activities.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/jaichim">Dave</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/dolphyfernandes">Dolphy</a> of <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/isobar">Isobar</a> were out for the first time and started working on a Java wrapper for the Health Graph API.  I&#8217;m excited to see this get done as it will really help encourage more Java app development with the RunKeeper API.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/im_a_muppet">Will Mernagh</a> from <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/iorahealth">Iora Health</a> also made it back out to continue working with <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/joe_lind">Joe Lind</a> on the Ruby wrapper, <a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/terriblelabs">BabyTooth</a>, which is getting very close to completion.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/ezyz">Yifei Zhang</a> of <a target="_blank" href="http://tapforge.com">TapForge</a> was also out working on front end design for the chartiable giving/challenges app that <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/doctorzaius">Jeremy Weiskotten</a> has been building.  This app is really shaping up and I&#8217;m excited to start using it when it&#8217;s done!</p>

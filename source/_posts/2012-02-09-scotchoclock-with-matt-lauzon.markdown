From his tweets alone, you can learn a lot.  I mean, unless you were in [Matt Lauzon’s](http://twitter.com/mattlauzon) shoes how would you ever gain enough insight to understand that: “[@MattLauzon](https://twitter.com/#!/mattlauzon/status/163720014275416065): the future is very interesting”.  Or, if you’re eager to land a job at [Gemvara](http://gemvara.com/), where else would you realize that you can impress their team by: “[@MattLauzon](https://twitter.com/#!/mattlauzon/status/167366786738683904): FACT: if you are ahead of the curve on @pinterest it is more likely that i will hire you”

But what you’ll learn most about Matt on Twitter is that he loves to help others.  His desire to see people succeed has manifested itself into one of the year’s biggest events, [#RubyRiot](http://therubyriot.com/).  #RubyRiot is all about the concept of #PayItForward.  For example, if you’re looking for a new gig, co-founder, capital or introduction to someone specific, the folks at #RubyRiot will #PayItForward by helping you find a way to fulfill your goal.

So head out to Estate on February 21 to meet Matt and #PayItForward!

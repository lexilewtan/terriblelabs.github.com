His real name is Mike Schneider but he'll tell you to call him [SchneiderMike](http://twitter.com/schneidermike). When he's not posting photos of different bottles of scotch, champagne or wine on Path you can find Mike running the [Digital Incubator at Allen & Gerritsen](http://www.a-g.com/Digital-Incubator/).

I'm going to credit Mike with getting the Boston tech scene [back involved in Path](http://www.schneidermike.com/technology/can-you-put-lipstick-on-a-path/1568/). I wasn't a believer but Mike convinced me it was worth my time and now I'm addicted. Why does this matter you ask? Mike is an early adopter, influencer and more importantly, uber vocal evangelist in Boston that can be the difference in getting your startup early traction.

Don't let Mike fool you though, he knows tons of people in the tech space across the country, from CEOs at hot consumer web startups to the writers at influential tech publications. Reach out to Mike if you're looking for feedback on your startup or just want someone to drink a scotch with. He's here to help!

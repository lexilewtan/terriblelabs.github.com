There are few people who have as much energy and passion for what they do as [Christopher](http://twitter.com/markitecht).  Currently, he’s the Director of Product Management at Hubspot after [Hubspot](http://hubspot.com/) acquired the company he used to work for, Performable.

His contagious excitement for the products he builds and markets, makes him nearly as good a salesman of Hubspot as their other great salespeople like [Ryan Neu](http://twitter.com/ryanrneu).  So, if you’re looking for help fleshing out your product and getting it out there in front of your target audience, get in touch with Christopher or attend out one of his classes at [Intelligent.ly](http://intelligent.ly/).

I’ll be honest, the first time I met Mike Troiano ([@MikeTrap](http://twitter.com/miketrap)), I was intimidated.  He’s not only a super successful entrepreneur, having been on the founding team of m-Qube (sold to VeriSign in 2006), founding CEO of Ogilvy & Mather Interactive and President of Primix Solutions but he’s also in the [1% of most influential people on Twitter](https://twitter.com/#!/miketrap)!

When Mike isn’t comparing his life to that of [Louis C.K.](http://bostinno.com/channels/what-you-can-learn-from-louis-ck/), he’s recording [Troiano family recipes](http://www.tastebook.com/recipe_books/284736-Troiano-Family-Recipes) for those who are looking to impress anyone with a good meal (I may have purchased his cookbook).  Mike has been a huge catalyst for the local Boston startup community from personally sponsoring tech events to playing host of Boston’s premiere event of the year, [Dave Balter Tech Prom](http://vimeo.com/31007625).

If you are looking for advice on how to position your startup in the market or guidance on the next steps for your startup career, Mike is a great resource.  Feel free to get in touch with Mike, he’s one of the most helpful people in the Boston scene.

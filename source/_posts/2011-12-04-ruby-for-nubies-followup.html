<p>We want to thank everyone who made it out this past weekend for our first <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23ruby4nubies" target="_blank">#Ruby4Nubies</a> class.  A big thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/doctorzaius" target="_blank">Jeremy</a> and<a href="http://twitter.com/semanticart" target="_blank"> Jeffrey</a> for putting it together and making it a fun learning experience.</p>

<p>For those of you who were there, a couple of the resources that will help you continue to sharpen your skills are:</p>

<p><span>Boston Ruby Group - <a href="http://bostonrb.org" target="_blank">bostonrb</a></span></p>

<p>Codeacademy for Ruby - <a href="http://tryruby.org" target="_blank">tryruby.org</a></p>

<p>Learn Ruby Tutorial - <a href="http://ruby.learncodethehardway.org/" target="_blank">Learn Ruby the Hard Way</a></p>

<p>We think that there is a strong demand to do this again but we may decide to do it in a several week course as opposed to a one day workshop.  The thought would be to touch on more than just Ruby.  We can do an overview of the components of a web app such as database design, javascript, Rails, etc to help people get to the point where they can mock up some simple prototypes.</p>

<p>So far we&#8217;ve heard a lot of positive feedback on the class but we&#8217;d love to get your criticism as well.  Feel free to shoot us an email with your thoughts to <a href="mailto:learn@terriblelabs.com" target="_blank">learn@terriblelabs.com</a>!</p>

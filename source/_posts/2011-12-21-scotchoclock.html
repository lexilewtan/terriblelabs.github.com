While we can&#8217;t help every startup develop their terribly awesome ideas, we work to provide as much technical and product guidance as possible while introducing entrepreneurs to those in the scene who can help them be successful.</p>

<p>Through #ScotchOClock, our goal is to highlight the individuals in Boston (and beyond) that you should get to know and feel comfortable with asking for help.  Tune in each Thursday in January, to check out Jeremy&#8217;s (<a href="http://twitter.com/DoctorZaius">@DoctorZaius</a>) latest interview.</p>

<p>All you&#8217;ll have to do is sit back, marvel at the incredible camera work by the <a href="http://apolismedia.com">Apolis Media</a> team, grab a glass of scotch, and have fun as we meet some great folks from around town.</p>

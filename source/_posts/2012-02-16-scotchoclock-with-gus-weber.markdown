[Gus Weber](http://twitter.com/gweber) has only been around the Boston scene for a few years but there are few people who have had a bigger impact on what you see going on today.  For example, several years ago, when we were getting [DartBoston](http://dartboston.com) going, very few people helped and supported us as much as Gus.  And I’m sure this example is true of many other organizations out there.

At the time, Gus used his role as evangelist at Microsoft  to not only financially support many of Boston’s tech oriented organizations but spent a lot of time and effort making sure that everyone found success.  Because of this, we have a very active and flourishing tech-startup community in Boston today.

Now Gus has taken his talents to Polaris Venture Partners where he oversees Polaris’ [Dogpatch Labs](http://dogpatchlabs.com/).  If you haven’t heard of Dogpatch before, it’s shared office space for entrepreneurs to work, connect and help one another build their companies.  If you’re interested in learning more about Dogpatch or just want to get advice on how to build a successful startup, make sure you get in touch with Gus!

It's been 9 months since Terrible Labs hatched.  It's bittersweet for us to announce that we are growing up and leaving our gracious hosts at [Gemvara](http://gemvara.com) for an office of our own on [Terrible Row](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=129+kingston+st+boston+ma&um=1&ie=UTF-8&hq=&hnear=0x89e37a786561b0eb:0xf6d9aa5b65ef905d,129+Kingston+St,+Boston,+MA+02111&gl=us&ei=t5iFT7TbE8nVgQe5lNS7Bw&sa=X&oi=geocode_result&ct=image&resnum=1&ved=0CCIQ8gEwAA).

With our own space, we plan to get back into the groove of hosting community events, teaching Ruby4Nubies and co-working with other startups.  However, in order for us to get any work done we'll need to buy office furniture which is why we decided to enter [Turnstone's $25k office makeover](http://myturnstone.com/contest/).

Check out our video submission and learn why in May of 2012, Terrible Labs, with the help of Turnstone, will introduce their new office.  And you'll see why it no longer looks like it's from 1984 (voice cameo from [Curt Nickisch](http://twitter.com/curtnickisch)!).

I feel like every time I see a [Jennifer Lum](http://twitter.com/jenniferlum) update cross my twitter or path feed, she’s in a new city doing something really impressive. There are two interesting takeaways from this observation. First, I think Jennifer has accumulated more airline miles than George Clooney’s character in [‘Up in the Air‘](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1193138/), and second, she has to be the hardest working person I’ve ever met.

Jennifer does it all.  She’s an angel investor through her company [Apricot Capital](http://apricotcapital.wordpress.com/about/), she’s a mentor at [TechStars](http://www.techstars.com/program/mentors/jlum/), she’s a mentor at [500 Startups](http://500.co/mentors/jennifer-lum/), she is super active in the Boston community through [Boston Boogie](http://bostonboogie.tumblr.com/), and as if that weren’t enough, she is currently running her own startup.  Jennifer has a ton of [experience building companies](http://www.linkedin.com/in/jenniferlum) and is someone who makes the time to help those looking for guidance.  So feel free to hit up Jennifer if you think she can be helpful to you or your startup!

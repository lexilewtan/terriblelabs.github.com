There aren’t many people in Boston who are as open as [Sean]("http://twitter.com/rseanlindsay") when it comes to helping entrepreneurs.  Sean works with entrepreneurs by offering technical guidance, making introductions and even playing full time, startup advisor.

While most of us would consider this to be a full time job, Sean is also the co-founder and CTO of the gaming distribution company [Viximo]("http://viximo.com/"), heads up [Founder Mentors]("http://foundermentors.com/?source=seanlindsay.com"), an organization that helps foster mentorship by pairing experienced entrepreneurs with new ones, and is an avid blogger at [Startup Lessons]("http://startuplessons.com/").  If you’re looking for help or guidance on your startup, Sean is the guy to talk to!

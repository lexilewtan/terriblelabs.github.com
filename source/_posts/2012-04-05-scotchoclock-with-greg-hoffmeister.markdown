Forget calling him Greg… He’s [‘The Hoff‘](http://twitter.com/gwhoffmeister)… And the Hoff is part of the dynamic team at [T3 Advisors](http://t3advisors.com/).  Since he and his partner in crime [Jon Frisch](http://twitter.com/jfrisch21) hit the scene with a vengeance, they have established themselves as the go to team to help your company find the perfect office space.

Aside from commercial real estate, T3 and Hoff are huge supporters of the Boston startup community.  They are always out around town and are sponsors of a ton of great startup events.  So if you need help finding your company’s next space or just want to play word association games with Hoff, feel free to get in touch.

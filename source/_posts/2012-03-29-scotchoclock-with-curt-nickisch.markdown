I’m not going to lie, I’m a big NPR fan and listen to it every day through their mobile app and at work.  But one thing that has always driven me crazy has been trying to figure out what Bob Oakes, Kai Ryssdal, Click and Clack, and the rest of the NPR gang actually look like.  So rather than use Google image search to uncover this mystery, we at Terrible Labs decided to bring on one of Boston’s best voices from [WBUR]("http://wbur.org/"), [Curt Nickisch](http://twitter.com/curtnickisch).

I’ve gotten to know Curt over the last few months and he’s one of the most helpful people I know.  If you’re interested in learning how to get your company publicized through main stream media or want to see for yourself that Curt is more than just a voice on the radio, feel free get in touch with him.

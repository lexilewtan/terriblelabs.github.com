<p>This past weekend we hosted the first APIs and IPAs event with RunKeeper.  Before I get into the recap I just want to thank <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/winterwyman">Winter Wyman</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/svb_financial">Silicon Valley Bank</a> for sponsoring the day and <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/gemvara">Gemvara</a> for letting us use their beautiful new office space to host the event.  Also, congratulations to Greg Rublev for winning Winter Wyman&#8217;s $200 Amazon gift card!</p>

<p>We had a solid turnout of developers who were interested in learning more about <a target="_blank" href="http://developer.runkeeper.com">RunKeeper&#8217;s Health Graph API</a> and building apps for the RunKeeper community.  There was a large contingent of Ruby developers who banded together to focus on a couple different problems in the RunKeeper ecosystem.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/joe_lind">Joe Lind</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/im_a_muppet">Will Mernagh</a> spent a majority of their efforts building RunKeeper&#8217;s Ruby Wrapper, <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/terriblelabs/BabyTooth">Baby Tooth</a>.  <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/doctorzaius">Jeremy Weiskotten&#8217;s</a> team focused on building an app (still needs a name) that leverages the game layer to help RunKeeper users raise money for charities by completing fitness challenges.  And finally <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/semanticart">Jeffrey Chupp</a> led a team working on an app that uses RunKeeper to track a user&#8217;s sleep.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://blog.terriblelabs.com/post/10170542262/apiandiparecap1">Check out the video</a> from and Jeffrey, Joe and Jeremy&#8217;s presentations.  Thanks to <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/hikerinheels">Arestia Rosenberg</a> for filming and editing!</p>

<p>We ended up running out of time to put the polish on all of these apps so we&#8217;ve decided to spend the rest of this quarter working with the Health Graph API.  Every other <strong>Wednesday night at Gemvara (starting 9/21)</strong>, we&#8217;ll be getting together from <strong>6pm to 9pm</strong> to finish apps that have already been started and potentially create a few more.</p>

<p>If you weren&#8217;t able to make it out on Sunday, feel free to sign up and swing by, we&#8217;d love to have you.</p>

<p>Also, as this was our first foray into a hackathon style of event, we&#8217;d love to get the community&#8217;s feedback.  Are you interested in learning more about local startups&#8217; APIs and building apps on them?  If you came to the event, what did you like, what didn&#8217;t you like?  If you didn&#8217;t make it out we&#8217;d love to hear your 2 cents as well!  Please leave us your thoughts in the comments!</p>

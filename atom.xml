    <id>http://blog.terriblelabs.com/blog/2012/01/04/step-away-from-the-presentational-classes</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A long, long time ago (2004 A.D.) the W3C
<a href="http://www.w3.org/QA/Tips/goodclassnames">posted a tip</a> for web developers:</p>

<blockquote><p>Use class with semantics in mind.</p></blockquote>


<p>Most web developers apparently didn&#8217;t
get the memo &#8211; many web sites still use CSS classes that are presentational
in nature, adding no real meaning or value to the HTML document. I think this
is a problem, and it&#8217;s a problem worth talking more about and making an effort
toward solving.</p>

<p>First, a bit of history to make the distinction between <em>semantic markup</em> and
<em>semantic classes</em>, just to make sure we&#8217;re on the same page.</p>

<h2>Semantic markup</h2>

<p>Semantic markup means using meaningful, self-descriptive HTML elements
rather than a bunch of generic divs. The reasons to use semantic markup are
well-reasoned and well-documented, but the argument ultimately boils down to
improving maintainability and flexibility, while better conveying significance
and meaning within the document to agents, including screen readers (for
accessibility) and search engine crawlers (like Googlebot).</p>

<p>I remember when everyone (every. one.) used HTML tables to lay out their web
pages. Nested tables. Nested nested tables. It worked, but it sucked pretty
hard. A movement toward semantic markup took over, led by the likes of
Jeffrey Zeldman, Eric Meyer, and Dan Cederholm.</p>

<p>Tables were relegated to their proper job, presenting tabular data. HTML
markup became more focused on document structure and content. Layout, being a
style concern, was instead described in CSS (which, by the way, we fervently
import from a separate file, and never, ever, hardly-ever specify inline).</p>

<p>By separating layout from our markup, we started building more maintainable,
flexible, accessible, meaningful documents. It sucked a lot less!</p>

<p>But a common problem cropped up, which we affectionately/bitterly call
<em>divitis</em> &#8211; using div elements as generic containers for lots of kinds of
things. Sometimes divitis happened because the developer didn&#8217;t know about
a more semantic alternative:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>This garbage is almost as bad as using tables for layout.</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='css'><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nt">div</span> <span class="nt">id</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;header1&quot;</span><span class="o">&gt;&lt;</span><span class="nt">b</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="nt">About</span> <span class="nt">My</span> <span class="nt">Cats</span><span class="o">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">b</span><span class="o">&gt;&lt;/</span><span class="nt">div</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Sometimes divitis happened because there <em>wasn&#8217;t</em> a more semantic alternative:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='css'><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nt">div</span> <span class="nt">id</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;footer&quot;</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="nt">Copyright</span> <span class="nt">2008</span><span class="o">.&lt;/</span><span class="nt">div</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><a href="http://html5doctor.com/">HTML5</a> came along and introduced us to a bunch of
new semantic friends: <code>header</code>, <code>footer</code>, <code>nav</code>, <code>section</code>, <code>aside</code>, etc.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='css'><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nt">header</span><span class="o">&gt;&lt;</span><span class="nt">h1</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="nt">About</span> <span class="nt">My</span> <span class="nt">Cats</span><span class="o">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">h1</span><span class="o">&gt;&lt;/</span><span class="nt">header</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nt">footer</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="nt">Copyright</span> <span class="nt">2008</span><span class="o">.&lt;/</span><span class="nt">footer</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If we have to, we can use tools like <a href="http://www.modernizr.com/">Modernizr</a>
to support HTML5 in shitty browsers like Internet Explorer (which is shitty).</p>

<h3>Semantic Classes</h3>

<p>Remember that tip from the W3C? &#8220;Use <code>class</code> with semantics in mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>The W3C recommends against presentational classes. Classes (if any) should
describe <em>what</em> an element is, not <em>how</em> it should look. Here are some
examples of markup that uses presentational classes, which might look
familiar because they aren&#8217;t all that uncommon in the real world:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Presentational classes are bad&#8230; m&#8217;kay?</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;p</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;orange bold&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Your credit card has expired!<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;a</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;buttonBig green&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Sign Up<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;nav</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;left&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>...<span class="nt">&lt;/nav&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='It&#8217;s like wearing a T-shirt that says &#8220;RED&#8221; which just so happens to actually be red. '>
This is semantic markup, and that&#8217;s great. But the classes are presentational,
which is not so great. They&#8217;re considered &#8220;presentational&#8221; because they
describe how the element is to be styled: position, weight, color, size. The
actual styling is implemented in CSS, but this information doesn&#8217;t really
belong in the markup.
It&#8217;s like wearing a T-shirt that says &#8220;RED&#8221; which just so happens to actually be red.
</span></p>

<ul>
<li>What if we want that bold, orange text to be italic and yellow? We&#8217;d have to change our markup just to change style.</li>
<li>What if the designer wants to change the green &#8220;Sign Up&#8221; button to red, and make it extra big? We&#8217;d have to change our markup just to change style.</li>
<li>What if we want to move the navigation elements to the right side of the page, or horizontally across the top? Guess what&#8230; We&#8217;d have to change our markup just to change style.</li>
</ul>


<p>We should be able to make most style changes by simply editing our CSS, not
our markup, and we should not have to pollute our markup with presentational
noise. Presentational details are the responsibility of CSS, not HTML!</p>

<p>Compare with these versions:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;p</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;warning&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span> Your credit card has expired!<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;a</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;primary&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Sign Up<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;nav</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;submenu&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>...<span class="nt">&lt;/nav&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>We&#8217;ve replaced the presentational classes with classes that describe what
each element <em>is</em> rather than what it should <em>look like</em>. We&#8217;ve completely
separated presentations details from the structure of the document. Now we can
change our design by editing CSS, not our markup. That&#8217;s awesome!</p>

<p><strong>But there&#8217;s still room for improvement&#8230;</strong> (This is where you might start to disagree with me.)</p>

<p>One of the benefits of CSS classes is that they make it really easy to reuse
a collection of style rules. For example, the popular
<a href="http://www.positioniseverything.net/easyclearing.html">PIE clearfix hack</a>
looks something like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='css'><span class='line'><span class="nc">.clearfix</span><span class="nd">:after</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">content</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;.&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">display</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="k">block</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">height</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="m">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">clear</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="k">both</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">visibility</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="k">hidden</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nc">.clearfix</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="k">display</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="k">inline</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="k">block</span><span class="p">;}</span>  <span class="c">/* for IE/Mac */</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Of course, these rules are only applied to an element if you include the
<code>clearfix</code> class in your markup, like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;section</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">&quot;container&quot;</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;clearfix&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>...<span class="nt">&lt;/section&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If you have a moderately complex layout you might need to use this class
in a bunch of places &#8211; in your markup! That sucks! But CSS doesn&#8217;t give you
a better mechanism for reuse.</p>

<p>Fortunately, some smart people have solved this problem for us!</p>

<h2>Sass and Less: Mixins</h2>

<p><a href="http://sass-lang.com">Sass</a> and <a href="http://lesscss.org">Less</a> are two popular
open source CSS extensions. They add features that make CSS easier to work
with and more powerful, including rule nesting, variables, and <em>mixins</em>.
Mixins allow you to reuse a chunk of CSS in different rules.</p>

<p>Sass and Less are pretty comparable, but I&#8217;m more familiar with Sass and it&#8217;s
supported out of the box by new Rails apps, so that will be our focus.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s how you define a mixin to implement that zany PIE clearfix hack in Sass
(using the SCSS syntax, which looks a lot like regular CSS):</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sass'><span class='line'><span class="k">@mixin</span><span class="nf"> pie-clearfix</span> <span class="err">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="na">display</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="no">inline</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="no">block</span><span class="err">;</span> <span class="cm">/* for IE/Mac </span><span class="c">*/</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">&amp;</span><span class="nd">:after</span> <span class="err">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="na">content</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;.&quot;</span><span class="err">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="na">display</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="no">block</span><span class="err">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="na">height</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="err">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="na">clear</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="no">both</span><span class="err">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="na">visibility</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="no">hidden</span><span class="err">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="err">}</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="err">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Then, to use this mixin in a CSS rule, just <code>@include</code> your mixin (along with any
other styles for that rule):</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sass'><span class='line'><span class="nt">section</span><span class="nn">#container</span> <span class="err">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">@include</span><span class="nd"> pie-clearfix</span><span class="err">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="na">background-color</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="mh">#000</span><span class="err">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="err">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now your markup is completely and hilariously free of any presentation classes:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;section</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">&quot;container&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>...<span class="nt">&lt;/section&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Note that you can also create mixins that take parameters, like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
<span class='line-number'>14</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sass'><span class='line'><span class="k">@mixin</span><span class="nf"> border-radius</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$radius</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="err">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="na">border-radius</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nv">$radius</span><span class="err">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="na">-moz-border-radius</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nv">$radius</span><span class="err">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="na">-webkit-border-radius</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nv">$radius</span><span class="err">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="err">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">nav</span> <span class="err">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">@include</span><span class="nd"> border-radius</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">8</span><span class="kt">px</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="err">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="err">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">section</span><span class="nn">#container</span> <span class="err">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">@include</span><span class="nd"> pie-clearfix</span><span class="err">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">@include</span><span class="nd"> border-radius</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">16</span><span class="kt">px</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="err">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="err">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h4>Example: Compass &amp; Blueprint</h4>

<p>The <a href="http://compass-style.org">Compass</a> framework defines a lot of useful,
reusable, cross-browser compatible mixins. It&#8217;s definitely worth checking out
if you decide to use Sass. Compass includes some clearfix hacks, gradients,
border radius, and a module that implements the
<a href="http://blueprintcss.org">Blueprint</a> grid and typography system.</p>

<p>Blueprint defines a bunch of presentational classes, such as <code>.container</code> to
define a grid container, <code>.span-x</code> to define a row with x columns, <code>.append-x</code>
and <code>.prepend-x</code> to append or prepend empty columns to a row, and much more.
Presentational classes. Sigh.</p>

<p>Ingeniously, the Compass
<a href="http://compass-style.org/reference/blueprint/">Blueprint module</a> turns these
classes into reusable mixins, so you can move presentation details into CSS
where it belongs!</p>

</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">@include</span><span class="nd"> column</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n-Pseudo">true</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="err">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="err">}</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="err">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h4>Example: Less &amp; Twitter Bootstrap</h4>

<p>Here&#8217;s one last example, using the super popular (most-watched project on
GitHub) <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Twitter Bootstrap</a>
CSS/JavaScript toolkit (which is built with Less):</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;button</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;btn primary&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Primary<span class="nt">&lt;/button&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Presentational classes? The nerve! Since Bootstrap is built with Less, you
should be able to use <code>.btn</code> and <code>.primary</code> as mixins in your .less stylesheet
instead of using them as presentational classes (being a Sass zealot, I
have not tried this).</p>

<h3>Thoughts?</h3>

<p>Are you convinced? Have you committed to doing away with presentational
classes in the past, but encountered real-world scenarios where they made
sense? Comments and feedback are welcome!</p>

While we can&#8217;t help every startup develop their terribly awesome ideas, we work to provide as much technical and product guidance as possible while introducing entrepreneurs to those in the scene who can help them be successful.</p>

<p>Through #ScotchOClock, our goal is to highlight the individuals in Boston (and beyond) that you should get to know and feel comfortable with asking for help.  Tune in each Thursday in January, to check out Jeremy&#8217;s (<a href="http://twitter.com/DoctorZaius">@DoctorZaius</a>) latest interview.</p>

<p>All you&#8217;ll have to do is sit back, marvel at the incredible camera work by the <a href="http://apolismedia.com">Apolis Media</a> team, grab a glass of scotch, and have fun as we meet some great folks from around town.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img align="top" height="250" src="http://instagr.am/p/XG8s-/media/?size=l" width="250"/></p>

<p>We want to thank everyone who made it out this past weekend for our first <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23ruby4nubies" target="_blank">#Ruby4Nubies</a> class.  A big thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/doctorzaius" target="_blank">Jeremy</a> and<a href="http://twitter.com/semanticart" target="_blank"> Jeffrey</a> for putting it together and making it a fun learning experience.</p>

<p>For those of you who were there, a couple of the resources that will help you continue to sharpen your skills are:</p>

<p><span>Boston Ruby Group - <a href="http://bostonrb.org" target="_blank">bostonrb</a></span></p>

<p>Codeacademy for Ruby - <a href="http://tryruby.org" target="_blank">tryruby.org</a></p>

<p>Learn Ruby Tutorial - <a href="http://ruby.learncodethehardway.org/" target="_blank">Learn Ruby the Hard Way</a></p>

<p>We think that there is a strong demand to do this again but we may decide to do it in a several week course as opposed to a one day workshop.  The thought would be to touch on more than just Ruby.  We can do an overview of the components of a web app such as database design, javascript, Rails, etc to help people get to the point where they can mock up some simple prototypes.</p>

<p>So far we&#8217;ve heard a lot of positive feedback on the class but we&#8217;d love to get your criticism as well.  Feel free to shoot us an email with your thoughts to <a href="mailto:learn@terriblelabs.com" target="_blank">learn@terriblelabs.com</a>!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/doctorzaius/status/136790167821357056">Ruby for Nubies</a><br/><p><img height="150" src="http://degreedirectory.org/cimages/multimages/2/computer_programming.jpg" width="200"/></p>

<p>We&#8217;ve gotten a great response from <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/doctorzaius/status/136790167821357056" target="_blank">Jeremy&#8217;s tweet</a> about an introductory worshop to Ruby, so we&#8217;ll be hosting one on December 3 from 9am to 3pm.  We have limited spots for this so if you&#8217;d like to come please shoot us a note at <a href="mailto:learn@terriblelabs.com" target="_blank">learn@terriblelabs.com</a>.</p>

<p>This first workshop will be an intro to Ruby (and it looks like this will be an intro to programming for some of the attendees). We won&#8217;t cover anything Rails specific, but we&#8217;ll tailor the content to people who eventually want to level up to Rails.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ll go over basic programming constructs (conditions and loops), functions, blocks, data types, data structures like Array and Hash, and maybe a brief intro to object-oriented programming with Ruby.<br/><br/><span>The format will be something like 15 minutes of lecture/examples with 15-30 minutes to experiment (in pairs) on the new topic, repeat. The goal will be to build out a simple interactive command-line game over the course of the day. We&#8217;ll have a handful of experienced Rubyists to help out with the hands-on work.</span><br/><br/><span>We don&#8217;t have have anything planned beyond this first Nubies workshop. It&#8217;s partly a market test for us (and we&#8217;ve gotten a great response), an opportunity to develop some content, and see what topics and formats might work going forward. I think the next logical step would be more advanced workshops on OOP with Ruby, Rails, JavaScript/CoffeeScript/</span><span>jQuery, etc.</span></p>

    <link href="http://blog.terriblelabs.com/blog/2011/10/05/observations-on-hiring-technical-talent/"/>
    <updated>2011-10-05T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.terriblelabs.com/blog/2011/10/05/observations-on-hiring-technical-talent</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve had a bunch of conversations over the past few weeks where every person has asked me the same question, &#8220;Do you know any engineers I can hire?&#8221;.  Non technical co-founders are looking to partner up with technical co-founders, bigger companies are looking to fill out their engineering staff and funded startups are looking to build their engineering teams.  Engineers are in high demand which means if you&#8217;re looking to hire one you&#8217;re going to have to work for it!</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s any sure fire way to go out and attract top developers as every company and situation is different.  I will however offer a few observations I&#8217;ve made of how some local companies are going about hiring.</p>

<p><strong>Relationship building</strong></p>

<p>When chatting with a few companies and asking how they were able to build their engineering teams, they remarked that they had leveraged the connections they had made while working at previous companies.  One company went back to a previous employer (don&#8217;t worry lawyers and employers in MA, they didn&#8217;t infringe on their non-solicitation agreements) and recruited engineers they had worked with in the past.</p>

<p>One person who didn&#8217;t have the luxury of leveraging a former engineering staff, pounded the pavement, becoming a regular at different developer meetups around town.  He told me that over the course of a year, he was able to develop strong relationships with developers eager to refer him engineering candidates.</p>

<p><strong>Monetary Incentive</strong></p>

<p>With such a high demand for tech talent, companies have been throwing a lot of cash at the problem.  I&#8217;m sure everyone is aware that <a target="_blank" href="http://bostinnovation.com/2011/01/24/refer-a-hubspot-developer-get-10k-join-hubspot-as-a-dev-get-a-4k-shopping-spree/">HubSpot is paying $10k</a> for any referred new technical hire that stays at the company for a specific amount of time.  Performable was also playing the same game, <a target="_blank" href="http://bostinnovation.com/2011/04/19/a-second-shot-heard-round-the-dev-community-performable-to-offer-12k-talent-referral/">offering $12k per developer</a>, before being acquired by HubSpot.  If you have the money and need the talent, throwing cash around could potentially help.</p>

<p><strong>Poach</strong></p>

<p>There has been a lot of angel and VC money flowing into the startup scene over the past few years.  Many of these startups, who have been around for a while, ramped up quickly, filling out their engineering teams but still have yet to achieve the rocket growth they expected.  After chatting with a few engineers at these types of companies, I&#8217;ve learned that given the right situation they&#8217;d be inclined to join a new team and attack a new problem.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re a startup, I&#8217;d also take a look at larger companies and agencies.  Many of these developers are super active in the developer community and get involved in the various hackathons and user groups around town.  While <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.terriblelabs.com/post/10562512485/apis-and-ipas-9-21-with-runkeeper">hosting a couple of hackathons</a>, I&#8217;ve had a chance to chat with several engineers working at larger corporations.  It was really interesting for me to hear how many of these guys are actually interested in joining a startup.  After one engineer made a similar statement at a recent APIs and IPAs, he was instantly bombarded with interest from several big name startups.</p>

<p><strong>Generate &#8216;The Perfect Storm&#8217;</strong></p>

<p>There are several companies in Boston that are great at generating &#8216;the perfect storm&#8217; and as a byproduct, have had an easier time attracting talent.</p>

<p>The first step to creating the perfect storm is to make yourself the prettiest girl in the room.  Just as you would when trying to raise money, the more hype you can create for your company the more interested everyone (not just engineers) will be in helping you execute your vision.  By being the prettiest girl in Boston, you&#8217;ll have an easy time attracting talent.</p>

<p>The second step is to sell a grand vision that solves an interesting problem.  To achieve this, it helps to have an incredible storyteller.  It&#8217;s not that you want to sell ice to eskimos but you want to tell the story of how you are going to change the world.  You&#8217;re doing this when you&#8217;re talking to VCs and angles, so do the same when you&#8217;re trying to recruit talent as well.</p>

<p>The final step in creating the perfect storm is to already have great people on your team.  When joining a company, people want to move their career forward and become more valuable.  The best way to do this is to improve one&#8217;s skills by learning from super experienced people like the <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/#!/dcancel">David Cancel</a>&#8217;s, <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/dharmesh">Dharmesh Shah</a>&#8217;s, <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/#!/rseanlindsay">Sean Lindsay</a>&#8217;s, and <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/#!/wkoffel">Will Koffe</a>l&#8217;s of the world.  Companies that are able to convey the aptitude of their team tend to be much prettier than the others.</p>

<p>These are just a few observations I&#8217;ve made over the past few years.  I&#8217;d love to hear any other thoughts people have!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been fun to watch the growth of Boston&#8217;s early stage tech community over the past few years. Companies that once had trouble finding the resources to help them succeed are now finding the support they need to be successful. Because so many companies are being nurtured, it&#8217;s been interesting to watch a new problem become more prevalent: the retention of good talent.</p>

<p>All of us here at Terrible Labs have had the opportunity to work at several early stage companies in various product, engineering and sales roles. We&#8217;ve seen how hard it is to come by great talent in years past and now that the market for A-players becomes more and more competitive, companies should be focusing on creating great environments for their talent to work in.</p>

<p>As we too continue to build our company and team, here are a few things we&#8217;re constantly thinking about&#8230;</p>

<h3>Culture</h3>

<p>We&#8217;ve seen first hand what it&#8217;s like to build a company culture and we know it&#8217;s not easy.</p>

<p>Yes, the building and execution of your product is super important and no doubt you will deliver. What tends to be equally as important is the the road the team travels while building the product.</p>

<p>Your goal is to build a team that enjoys not only working together but spending long hours together. In order to achieve this, it&#8217;s all about getting out of the office and away from work. Allow your team to step out of their work shell and be themselves. Whether that means going out for drinks, taking a trip together, going out for dinner or singing karaoke, allow your team to share in unique experiences and in turn you&#8217;ll have a team that&#8217;s closer and better friends.</p>

<p>The journey will be long, make sure it&#8217;s enjoyable for everyone along the way.</p>

<h3>Learning</h3>

<p>The people you&#8217;ve hired to work on your team are the ones who are willing to get their hands dirty and solve big problems. People join companies not for the paycheck but because they&#8217;re passionate about a space, problem or team.</p>

<p>Make sure the problem you&#8217;re solving is well stated and interesting. Your team should light up when they talk about what they&#8217;re working on and who they&#8217;re working with.</p>

<p>If that&#8217;s not the case, empower your team to explore subsets of the problem you&#8217;re trying to solve. This doesn&#8217;t have to be their full-time job but an opportunity for them to be creative and come up with solutions you may have never thought possible.</p>

<h3>Communication</h3>

<p>The team you&#8217;ve assembled should be stacked with people you believe in and trust to execute your company&#8217;s grand vision. No doubt issues and detours will arise, it&#8217;s expected at any company. The important part to remember is to treat your team with the trust you&#8217;d expect them to confide in you.</p>

<p>When unfortunate speed-bumps present themselves, be open with your team and work on solving the problem together. A lack of communication merely delays the inevitable, difficult conversation and ultimately leads to a more negative response from your team.</p>

<p>Like all successful relationships (because I would know), successful teams are built on transparency and communication.</p>

<h3>The Future Looks Competitive</h3>

<p>I&#8217;m excited to watch as more companies startup here in Boston. The ecosystem is getting stronger each day and the companies more compelling. Just make sure you are conscious of the environment you&#8217;re creating otherwise you may find yourself a lonely, one man team.</p>

    <id>http://blog.terriblelabs.com/blog/2011/09/23/10562512485</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img align="text-top" src="http://yfrog.com/nuzuooj:tw1" width="334" height="200"/></p>

<p>We had another fun night at <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/gemvara">Gemvara</a> working with the <a target="_blank" href="http://developer.runkeeper.com">RunKeeper HealthGraph API</a>.</p>

<p>As we talked about in the last blog post, we&#8217;re still trying to figure out how best to run these hack-fests.  For the next couple months we&#8217;re going to meet up every other Wednesday night at Gemvara from 6pm to 9pm to continue working with the RunKeeper API.  </p>

<p>On November 16th we&#8217;re going to get together for a final presentation night where we can recap on the apps we&#8217;ve built and demo them to the greater Boston community and to the RunKeeper team.</p>

<p>I know<a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/jjacobs22"> Jason Jacobs</a> (CEO of RunKeeper) is willing to leverage the RunKeeper press machine to highlight apps built during APIs and IPAs, so if you&#8217;re interested in getting some exposure for yourself and your app, come out and get involved!</p>

<p>Sign up for the next one on 10/5&#8230;</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://apipa3.eventbrite.com?ref=ebtn"><img alt="Register for API&amp;#39;s and IPA&amp;#39;s: RunKeeper 10/5 in Boston, MA  on Eventbrite" src="http://www.eventbrite.com/registerbutton?eid=2235598736" border="0"/></a></p>

<p>This past Wednesday, we were psyched to have team <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/evertrue">EverTrue</a> out which included <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/brentgrinna">Brent</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/evertrueeric">Eric</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/jessebardo">Jesse</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/andrewburch">Drew</a>, Courtney, <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/andrhamm">Andrew</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/tonyd256">Anthony</a>.  These guys spent their time building an app that incorporates charitable giving with exercise.  Keep your eye out for their RunKeeper app, I&#8217;ve got a feeling that when they present in November the demo will be very cool!</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/patientslikeme">Patients Like Me</a> was also well represented by <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/semanticart">Jeffrey Chupp</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.patientslikeme.com/members/view/17">Jeff Cole</a>.  Jeffrey continued to work on his app for recording one&#8217;s sleep while Jeff was working on a map overlay that allows Runkeeper users to compare segments of the same route over time.  He&#8217;s currently looking at his morning commute by car, but this easily transfers over to cycling, running and other activities.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/jaichim">Dave</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/dolphyfernandes">Dolphy</a> of <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/isobar">Isobar</a> were out for the first time and started working on a Java wrapper for the Health Graph API.  I&#8217;m excited to see this get done as it will really help encourage more Java app development with the RunKeeper API.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/im_a_muppet">Will Mernagh</a> from <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/iorahealth">Iora Health</a> also made it back out to continue working with <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/joe_lind">Joe Lind</a> on the Ruby wrapper, <a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/terriblelabs">BabyTooth</a>, which is getting very close to completion.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/ezyz">Yifei Zhang</a> of <a target="_blank" href="http://tapforge.com">TapForge</a> was also out working on front end design for the chartiable giving/challenges app that <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/doctorzaius">Jeremy Weiskotten</a> has been building.  This app is really shaping up and I&#8217;m excited to start using it when it&#8217;s done!</p>

<p>This past weekend we hosted the first APIs and IPAs event with RunKeeper.  Before I get into the recap I just want to thank <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/winterwyman">Winter Wyman</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/svb_financial">Silicon Valley Bank</a> for sponsoring the day and <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/gemvara">Gemvara</a> for letting us use their beautiful new office space to host the event.  Also, congratulations to Greg Rublev for winning Winter Wyman&#8217;s $200 Amazon gift card!</p>

<p><img height="240" width="180" src="https://playfoursquare.s3.amazonaws.com/pix/WNCKYERZXRB40AVBL2QAV4QK1GWJ1XNSTJW3G3W3ERH4ETPB.jpg" align="middle"/></p>

<p>We had a solid turnout of developers who were interested in learning more about <a target="_blank" href="http://developer.runkeeper.com">RunKeeper&#8217;s Health Graph API</a> and building apps for the RunKeeper community.  There was a large contingent of Ruby developers who banded together to focus on a couple different problems in the RunKeeper ecosystem.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/joe_lind">Joe Lind</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/im_a_muppet">Will Mernagh</a> spent a majority of their efforts building RunKeeper&#8217;s Ruby Wrapper, <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/terriblelabs/BabyTooth">Baby Tooth</a>.  <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/doctorzaius">Jeremy Weiskotten&#8217;s</a> team focused on building an app (still needs a name) that leverages the game layer to help RunKeeper users raise money for charities by completing fitness challenges.  And finally <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/semanticart">Jeffrey Chupp</a> led a team working on an app that uses RunKeeper to track a user&#8217;s sleep.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://blog.terriblelabs.com/post/10170542262/apiandiparecap1">Check out the video</a> from and Jeffrey, Joe and Jeremy&#8217;s presentations.  Thanks to <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/hikerinheels">Arestia Rosenberg</a> for filming and editing!</p>

<p>We ended up running out of time to put the polish on all of these apps so we&#8217;ve decided to spend the rest of this quarter working with the Health Graph API.  Every other <strong>Wednesday night at Gemvara (starting 9/21)</strong>, we&#8217;ll be getting together from <strong>6pm to 9pm</strong> to finish apps that have already been started and potentially create a few more.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://apiandipa2.eventbrite.com?ref=ebtn"><img border="0" src="http://www.eventbrite.com/registerbutton?eid=2182889080" alt="Register for API&amp;#39;s and IPA&amp;#39;s: RunKeeper 9/21 in Boston, MA  on Eventbrite"/></a></p>

<p>If you weren&#8217;t able to make it out on Sunday, feel free to sign up and swing by, we&#8217;d love to have you.</p>

<p>Also, as this was our first foray into a hackathon style of event, we&#8217;d love to get the community&#8217;s feedback.  Are you interested in learning more about local startups&#8217; APIs and building apps on them?  If you came to the event, what did you like, what didn&#8217;t you like?  If you didn&#8217;t make it out we&#8217;d love to hear your 2 cents as well!  Please leave us your thoughts in the comments!</p>
